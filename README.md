# BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
Company name
MyWorstJob : The name is funny but easy to remember. 
Slogan : It can’t get worse!

# Description of the company
You are doing the worst job imaginable or don't see any opportunities at your current company or didn't even have a job. How about a change?
In general, looking for work can be a difficult and stressful task for applicants. The same goes for recruiters too. Finding qualified employees that correspond to the required skills, is also often not easy. That's the point where our company comes into play. We connect searching applicants with the best matching companies.
Our aim is to make the process as simple as possible for both sides. Applicants don't have to search for a long time to find matching jobs and submitting the application is even easier.
MyWorstJob is a partnership online company owned and managed by Dustin Troppa and Rania Ouaja. 

# Business activities
People who are searching for a job or perhaps new prospects for their careers are our main target audience. In particular, we target recent grads looking for work or persons that are not satisfied with their current job. Allowing them to see a big amount of job offers in their study fields and to apply in a few steps.
Also, we target companies that are searching for employees, by giving them the opportunity to publish their job offers and to reach more interested people.
Benefits : One of the most important marketing strategies of the company is to identify the tar-get audience of our website and to focus on connecting both target groups that need our ser-vices. The idea is to gain a very large number of users/ visitors (big amount of traffic on the website) and to earn money through publishing advertisements.

# Description of the application 
Application name : MyWorstJob
Domain : MyWorstJob.de
The company offers to its customers a free application that allows recruiters from different companies to publish and update their job offers easily. Also, it allows candidates to explore jobs, that are matching their qualifications. The application offers to their users also the opportunity to create a profile and upload very simply and safely their documents (CV, motivation letter, qualifications etc.) to apply directly for the job offer. 
When you are a new user, you should be able to use the side normally. Until you come to a point where a registration is needed. The registration/login should always be possible.
In the registration stage, you should be able to switch between an applicant or a company. Depending on your choice, the right options should show. The same goes for the main window. The choice of buttons, in the main window, depends on your login statues. If you are logged in, then the different types of users should be handled accordingly.
On the job board, where all jobs are listed, should be a button for applying for the job. It would be nice if you have then the option to add a personalized application for the job. Else, you can take your standard application from your profile. A applicant should be notified if he got the job and which job he got.
On the other side, the company can see the application and go through the data of the user. After the company reads the application, there should be a choice to decline or accept the offer. If the applicant is accepted, then all other applicants are declined, and the job offer dis-appears.
Let's come to the data that's at least needed of an applicant and company.
For the applicant: Name, birthday, E-Mail, password, phone number, address, qualification, list of skills.
For the company: Name, address, E-Mail, password, phone number, description. 
But feel free to add more if you want to both of them.
